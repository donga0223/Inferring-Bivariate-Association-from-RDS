# Inferring-Bivariate-Association-from-RDS

This repository refers to the paper Dongah Kim, Krista J. Gile (2020). Inferring Bivariate Association from Respondent-Driven Sampling Data. In this paper, we proposed a method to semi-parametrically estimate the null distributions of standard test statistics in the presence of sampling dependence, allowing for more valid statistical testing for dependence between pairs of variables within the sample. 

[R_functions](https://github.com/donga0223/Inferring-Bivariate-Association-from-RDS/tree/master/R_functions) contains all R code for paper simulations. 
[sim.permutation.test.R](https://github.com/donga0223/Inferring-Bivariate-Association-from-RDS/blob/master/R_functions/sim.permutation.test.R) is a main function for NPBA.
