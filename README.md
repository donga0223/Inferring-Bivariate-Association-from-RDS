# Inferring-Bivariate-Association-from-RDS

This repository refers to the paper Dongah Kim, Krista J. Gile (2020). Inferring Bivariate Association from Respondent-Driven Sampling Data. In this paper, we proposed a method to semi-parametrically estimate the null distributions of standard test statistics in the presence of sampling dependence, allowing for more valid statistical testing for dependence between pairs of variables within the sample. 

The file [sim.permutation.test.R] contains the source functions for implementation of the proposed semiparametric test for bivariate association. The source functions in sim.permutation.test.R require the R packages RDS and network.
